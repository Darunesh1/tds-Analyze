# Data Analysis and Reporting Tool

## Overview

This project provides a Python-based tool for analyzing data from an Excel file and generating a JSON report. The `execute.py` script processes the data, and the results are made accessible via GitHub Pages.

## Features

*   Data processing and analysis using Python.
*   Generation of a structured JSON report.
*   Automated CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment.
*   Publishing of analysis results to GitHub Pages.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **Ensure Python 3.11+ and Pandas 2.3 are installed:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
3.  **Run the analysis script (for local testing):**
    ```bash
    python execute.py > result.json
    ```
    The `result.json` file will contain the analysis output.

## Technical Details

The core logic is implemented in `execute.py`. This script reads data from `data.csv` (converted from `data.xlsx`), performs specific analysis steps (details of which are within the script), and outputs the results in JSON format. The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) automates linting with Ruff, runs the analysis script, and deploys the generated `result.json` to GitHub Pages.
